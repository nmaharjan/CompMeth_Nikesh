# (a) The analytical value of the derivative at x = 1, is 1 and it is comparable to the numerical calculation eventhough not perfectly.

# (b) From the series of the delta variation, it is seen that the accuracy of the calculation initially upto 1e-10 gets better then get worse again. It is because the difference between the functional values goes very smaller.
